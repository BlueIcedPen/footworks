													If you want to know and be sure that you born again, you can be sure by doing exactly what Romans 10:9 says: <strong style="font-style:italic;">"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."</strong> Simply say with your mouth, believing in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead; wow…you can also be saved right now.
												</p><br/><br/>
												<h4><a>Pray Now!!</a></h4>
												<p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>"I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is my Lord: I believe in my heart that God has raised Him from the dead. Now, Oh, God, since you can't lie, and I have done what you said in Your Word, I believe that I am saved. Thank you, Heavenly Father for saving me. Amen."</strong></p>
												<br/><br/>
												<h4><a>Now that you are saved</a></h4>
												<p style="font-size: 14px;">
														If you sincerely did that, you are saved (born again) right now according to God's Word, Praise God!! God bless you. Now commit yourself to follow Jesus every day, by doing what His Word teaches about living for Him. Read your Bible every day, and pray (talk) to the Lord every day. Be thankful to Him, and tell Him to others! Amen.
												</p>
												<p style="font-size: 14px;">Please if you said the prayer, email us at : <a>www.footworksinternational@gmail.com</a>. We will be glad to share in this joy.</p>
												<p style="font-size: 14px;">Let’s hear from you so we can help you with materials and resources so you get the most out of the new life in Christ. Hallelujah…You are now a new creation; you have been born of God...Welcome to the family….Now heir of God.<br/><br/>
													<span style="font-style:italic;"> <strong>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. Rom 8:17</strong></span><br/><br/>
													Enjoy this new life and get in touch with any bible believing church around you
													We love you and glad you are a sibling in God.
